variable			line #
strings:
Background path		 	1
output folder path	 	2 Path to the folder you want the output to be in, not the name of the files.
output file names	 	3 Name of the output files. If FRAME is set here: FRAME_0, FRAME_1, etc. will be animation outputs
				  FRAME_X_Y.bmp, etc., and FRAME_POSITIONS.CSV, etc. will be data outputs 
integers:
width			 	4
height			 	5
frames			 	6

steps			 	7

doubles:
change in time per step	 	8

camera initial x	 	9
camera initial y		10
camera initial z		11

camera change in x per frame	12 for data mode, this is inital particle velocity
camera change in y per frame	13
camera change in z per frame	14

*****************************IMPORTANT*****************************

Change all "\" to "/" in the file paths and make sure they are valid.
ex: C:\Users\Name\Desktop\Background.bmp -> C:/Users/Name/Desktop/Background.bmp
all images must be bitmaps (.bmp)

*****THIS PROGRAM WILL OVERWRITE FILES WITHOUT WARNING################################################*****
So be sure the file paths are correct

This program takes a bitmap (.bmp) and a text (.txt) file (this file) as inputs,
and outputs several bitmaps (.bmp) (animation mode),
or several bitmaps (.bmp) and several Comma Separated Values (.CSV) files (data mode)
depending on the mode.
I recommend creating a folder for them in order to prevent clutter

formatting (follow these exactly or the program may not work):
strings: remove leading and trailing whitespace
Integers: numbers only, remove all whitespace, no negatives
doubles: "." indicates a decimal, "-" as the first character indicates a negative, remove all whitespace,
scientific notation for doubles in the form of aEb where the result is a*10^b. Ex: 2.34E-10 -> 0.000000000234
